# calculator
On-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Based on the Odin project assignment :
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator


To improve :

- backSpace when only only one number does't change the secondLine
- Can't put 0.001
- Can put 0..1
- No button:active when using the numpad
- Only react to numpad input
- When firstLine is to long it adds a line instead of scrolling
